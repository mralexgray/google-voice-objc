 * @author Joey Gibson <joey@joeygibson.com>
 * @since 04/11/2011
 *
 * @mainpage
 * This is an iOS library in Objective-C for interacting with Google Voice.
 *
 * I borrowed liberally from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-voice-java/">google-voice-java</a> which, as its name implies, 
 * was written in Java. This is not a direct port of google-voice-java, however. I made changes that made sense for Objective-C, 
 * and took several of the methods farther than they had been, returning NSDictionary objects with useful contents, instead of just raw strings.
 *
 * It also makes use of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/">json-framework</a> for dealing with the <tt>JSON</tt> responses from Google Voice. 
 *
 * <strong>Note: This library is not affiliated with Google in any way.</strong>
 *
 * This class provides methods to do most of what you'd want to
 * do with Google Voice. You can send SMS messages, initiate calls, enable/disable phones, change 
 * various settings, and download messages. Among other things.
